Temporarily named MoodPulse, built with Next.js
This project is a first one using Next.js App Router, as on my previous jobs I was using version 12 or earlier ones.
The goal is to learn the new version and some of it's features which are not yet stable.

## Updates
Tue 10 Oct
- After dealing with client side caching problems with Next App router, I've migrated to server actions which solved the caching problems.

## What it is

Version 0.0.1 of a personal web project, a very simple test version

## Why this version

After woking with Next.js 12 on my last jobs, I am looking forward to start building with the App Router and everything else Next.js 13/React 18 provide.

## What it can become

From this very simple test version, an MVP can be born, following some concepts I've been working on
